## Usage
```
On a social network API
- My server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database, when I enter the command to invoke the application.
- The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON, when I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts.
- I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database, when I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
- I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list, when I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
